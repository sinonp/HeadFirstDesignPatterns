The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. 
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

(Composition vs. inheritance)

Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Pattern (One to many relationship)

Inheritance defines behavior for an object statically. Composition provides it a runtime, allowing for greater flexibility.

Design Principles:
- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to an interface.

The Decorator Pattern: attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending
functionality.
